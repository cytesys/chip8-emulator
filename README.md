# CHIP8 Emulator
This is a CHIP8 emulator written in python. It works, but is very slow.

## How to run it?
First, you need to download a CHIP8 ROM somewhere into the Chip8/roms/ folder. \
In `main.py` there is a line that says `self.mem.load(../roms/Maze.ch8)`. To run a ROM, change the filename in that line.

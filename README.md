# CHIP8 Emulator
This is a CHIP8 emulator written in python. It works, but it is very slow.
No third-party libraries is needed.

## How to run it?
First, you need to download a CHIP8 ROM from somewhere, and put it in the `Chip8/roms/` folder. \
In `Chip8/main.py` there is a line that says `self.mem.load(../roms/Maze.ch8)`. To run a ROM, change the filename in that line.
